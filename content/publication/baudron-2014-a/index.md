abstract: Competition for crop residues between livestock feeding and soil mulching
  is a major cause of the low and slow adoption of conservation agriculture (CA) in
  sub-Saharan Africa. Retaining crop residues in the field is not only a prerequisite
  for CA but may also be the most viable option for African farmers to retain their
  fields in a productive state. In this paper, (1) we explore the possibility of increasing
  the quantity of crop residue available by closing the maize yield, (2) we propose
  interventions that can reduce crop residue demand for livestock feed, and (3) we
  quantify the optimum amount of crop residues required as mulch, using empirical,
  secondary and modeling data from Western Kenya and the Ethiopian Rift Valley. Residue
  retention can also be increased by reducing livestock demand. Closing the maize
  yield gap-i.e. achieve 90% of the water-limited yield potential-and intensifying
  dairy production-which would promote the use of rations that are more energy-dense
  than cereal residue-based rations-would increase the estimated proportion of farmers
  retaining at least 1tha-1 of crop residues from the current 36% to 97% in Western
  Kenya. In the Ethiopian Rift Valley, closing the maize yield gap and substituting
  mechanization to animal draught power would increase the estimated proportion of
  farmers retaining at least 1tha-1 of crop residues from the current 3% to 83%. We
  conclude that the question is not 'if', but 'how' cereal residues can fulfill the
  demand of both the soil and the livestock. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
