abstract: This chapter presents the results of a scoping study conducted along an
  agricultural intensification and forest cover gradient from Arsi-Negele town to
  Munessa Forest in southern Ethiopia. It summarizes preliminary research in the study
  area led by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (Centro Internacional
  de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo, CIMMYT) as part of the Agrarian Change Project,
  a multi-country comparative research project led by CIFOR. The objective was to
  gather information that will guide further research in the area including; characterization of the intensification gradient (context), access to resources, livelihood strategies, market access and value chains, institutional support, and perceptions of change (land-cover change and historical trends).
