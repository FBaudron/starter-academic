abstract: Since the paper by Giller et al. (2009), the debate surrounding the suitability
  of conservation agriculture (CA) for African smallholders has remained polarized
  between proponents and opponents. The debate also gave rise to a few studies that
  attempted to identify the 'niche' where CA would fit in the region, but the insight
  offered by these studies has been limited. In this paper, we first analyze the rationale
  of adoption where it occurred globally to define 'drivers' of adoption. Our analysis
  suggests that CA has first and foremost been adopted under the premises of being
  energy-saving (time and/or power), erosion-controlling, and water-use efficient,
  but rarely to increase yield. We then define the niche where CA fits, based on these
  drivers of adoption, as systems where (1) the energy available for crop establishment
  is limited and/or costly (including labor and draft power); (2) delayed planting
  results in a significant yield decline; (3) yield is limited or co-limited by water;
  and/or (4) severe erosion problems threaten the short- to medium-term productivity
  of farmland. In Eastern and Southern Africa, this niche appears rather large and
  likely to expand in the near future. When implemented within this niche, CA may
  still be limited by performance challenges' that do not constitute drivers or barriers
  to adoption, but limitations to the performance of CA. We argue that most of these
  performance challenges can (and should) be addressed by agronomic and socio-economic
  research, and provide four examples where the International Maize and Wheat Improvement
  Center (CIMMYT) and its partners have been successfully alleviating four very different
  challenges through research and development (R&D) in Eastern and Southern Africa.
  Finally, we describe an iterative and multi-scale R&D approach currently used by
  CIMMYT in Eastern and Southern Africa to overcome challenges associated with the
  implementation of CA by African smallholders. This approach could also be useful
  for other complex combinations of technologies aiming at sustainable intensification.
