abstract: "Zimbabwe's Mid-Zambezi Valley is of global importance for the emblematic\
  \ mega-fauna of Africa. Over the past 30. years rapid land use change in this area\
  \ has substantially reduced wildlife habitat. Tsetse control operations are often\
  \ blamed for this. In this study, we quantify this change for the Dande Communal\
  \ Area, Mbire District, of the Mid-Zambezi Valley and analyse the contribution of\
  \ three major potential drivers: (1) increase in human population; (2) increase\
  \ in cattle population (and the expansion of associated plough-based agriculture),\
  \ and; (3) expansion of cotton farming. Although direct effects of land use change\
  \ on wildlife densities could not be proven, our study suggests that the consequences\
  \ for elephant and buffalo numbers are negative. All three of the above drivers\
  \ have contributed to the observed land use change. However, we found farmland to\
  \ have expanded faster than the human population, and to have followed a similar\
  \ rate of expansion in cattle sparse, tsetse infested areas as in tsetse free areas\
  \ where cattle-drawn plough agriculture dominates. This implies the existence of\
  \ a paramount driver, which we demonstrate to be cotton farming. Contrary to common\
  \ belief, we argue that tsetse control was not the major trigger behind the dramatic\
  \ land use change observed, but merely alleviated a constraint to cattle accumulation.\
  \ We argue that without the presence of a cash crop (cotton), land use change would\
  \ have been neither as extensive nor as rapid as has been observed. Therefore, conservation\
  \ agencies should be as concerned by the way people farm as they are by population\
  \ increase. Conserving biodiversity without jeopardising agricultural production\
  \ will require the development of innovative technological and institutional options\
  \ in association with policy and market interventions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
