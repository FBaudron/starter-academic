 abstract = {It is our intent this series will be a source of information on conservation agriculture in Africa. It throws light on controversial issues such as the challenges farmers face in keeping the soil covered, in gaining access to adequate no-tillage seeding equipment, in controlling weeds, and on the challenges projects and institutions face in implementing truly participatory approaches to technology development, even as it illustrates the benefi ts of systems based in conservation agriculture and the enthusiasm with which many stakeholders are taking it up},
