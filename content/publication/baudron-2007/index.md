abstract: It is our intent this series will be a source of information on conservation
  agriculture in Africa. It throws light on controversial issues such as the challenges
  farmers face in keeping the soil covered, in gaining access to adequate no-tillage
  seeding equipment, in controlling weeds, and on the challenges projects and institutions
  face in implementing truly participatory approaches to technology development, even
  as it illustrates the benefits of systems based in conservation agriculture and
  the enthusiasm with which many stakeholders are taking it up.
