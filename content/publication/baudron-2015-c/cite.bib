 abstract = {Labour is increasingly constraining productivity of farming systems in Southern Africa, and the adoption of sustainable intensification is likely to compound the problem. Mechanization based on the use of small engines – such as multipurpose two-wheel tractors – is likely to be more appropriate to smallholders in the region than other forms of mechanization. Land preparation is the most power-intensive and the most critical farming operation in rainfed farming systems of Southern Africa. Reduced or no tillage make the use of two-wheel tractors for crop establishment viable in most of the region. Several direct seeders for two-wheel tractors are now commercially available, from countries such as China and Brazil. Direct seeding using a two-wheel tractor drastically reduces the time and labour needed to establish a crop. It is not profitable for farmers to own machines and operate only on their farm, but service provision is profitable. The profitability of service provision increases with the range of ancillary equipment available.},
