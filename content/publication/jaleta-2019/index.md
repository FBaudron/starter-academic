abstract: This paper reviews agricultural mechanization and reduced tillage use in
  the context of sustainable intensification in developing country agriculture. The
  scoping review includes selected and contrasting cases - including Zimbabwe (manual
  systems), Bangladesh (2-wheel single axle tractor systems), India (4-wheel i.e.,
  2 axles tractor systems), Kazakhstan (mechanized systems) and Brazil (diverse systems).
  The expansion of reduced tillage appears strongly associated with the level of agricultural mechanization – facilitated by a number of common drivers and contextualized by the prevailing farm power and intensity of tillage. Soil conservation, timely planting and farm power savings in crop establishment are important drivers for the expansion of reduced tillage across the world, facilitated by conducive markets, institutional
  and policy environments and the integration of diverse actors to introduce, adapt
  and promote the necessary components.
