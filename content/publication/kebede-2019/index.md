abstract: Lepidopteran stemborers are a serious pest of maize in Africa. While farmers
  have adopted cultural control practices at the field scale, it is not clear how
  these practices affect stemborer infestation levels and how their efficacy is influenced
  by landscape context. The aim of this 3-year study was to assess the effect of field
  and landscape factors on maize stemborer infestation levels and maize productivity.
  Maize infestation levels, yield and biomass production were assessed in 33 farmer
  fields managed according to local practices. When considering field level factors
  only, plant density was positively related to stemborer infestation level. During
  high infestation events, length of tunnelling was positively associated with planting
  date and negatively with the botanical diversity of hedges. However, the proportion
  of maize crop in the surrounding landscape was strongly and positively associated
  with length of tunnelling at 100, 500, 1000 and 1500 m radius, and overrode field
  level management factors when considered together. Maize grain yield was positively
  associated with plant density and soil phosphorus content, and not negatively associated
  with the length of tunnelling. Our findings highlight the need to consider a landscape
  approach for stemborer pest management, but also indicate that maize is tolerant
  to low and medium infestation levels of stemborers.
