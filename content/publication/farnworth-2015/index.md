abstract: It is remarkable that despite wide-ranging, in-depth studies over many years,
  almost no conservation agriculture (CA) studies consider gender and gender relations
  as a potential explanatory factor for (low) adoption rates. This is important because
  CA demands new ways of working with the farm system. Implementation will inevitably
  involve a reallocation of men's and women's resources as well as having an impact
  upon their ability to realize their gender interests. With respect to intra-household
  decision-making and the distribution of benefits, CA interventions have implications
  for labour requirements and labour allocation, investment decisions with respect
  to mechanization and herbicide use, crop choice, and residue management. CA practice
  may impact upon the ability of households to source a wide variety of crops, wild
  plants, and insects and small animals for household nutrition. Gender biases in
  extension service design can sideline women. This paper examines the limited research
  to date on the interactions between CA interventions and gender in East and Southern
  Africa, and, based on the gaps observed, sets out a research agenda. It argues that
  attention to gender in CA is particularly timely given the increasing interest in
  CA as a means of adapting to climate change.
