abstract: Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) currently grow rainfed maize
  with limited inputs including fertilizer. Climate change may exacerbate current
  production constraints. Crop models can help quantify the potential impact of climate
  change on maize yields, but a comprehensive multimodel assessment of simulation
  accuracy and uncertainty in these low-input systems is currently lacking. We evaluated
  the impact of varying [CO2], temperature and rainfall conditions on maize yield,
  for different nitrogen (N) inputs (0, 80, 160 kg N/ha) for five environments in
  SSA, including cool subhumid Ethiopia, cool semi-arid Rwanda, hot subhumid Ghana
  and hot semi-arid Mali and Benin using an ensemble of 25 maize models. Models were
  calibrated with measured grain yield, plant biomass, plant N, leaf area index, harvest
  index and in-season soil water content from 2-year experiments in each country to
  assess their ability to simulate observed yield. Simulated responses to climate
  change factors were explored and compared between models. Calibrated models reproduced
  measured grain yield variations well with average relative root mean square error
  of 26%, although uncertainty in model prediction was substantial (CV = 28%). Model
  ensembles gave greater accuracy than any model taken at random. Nitrogen fertilization
  controlled the response to variations in [CO2], temperature and rainfall. Without
  N fertilizer input, maize (a) benefited less from an increase in atmospheric [CO2];
  (b) was less affected by higher temperature or decreasing rainfall; and (c) was
  more affected by increased rainfall because N leaching was more critical. The model
  intercomparison revealed that simulation of daily soil N supply and N leaching plays
  a crucial role in simulating climate change impacts for low-input systems. Climate
  change and N input interactions have strong implications for the design of robust
  adaptation approaches across SSA, because the impact of climate change in low input
  systems will be modified if farmers intensify maize production with balanced nutrient
  management.
