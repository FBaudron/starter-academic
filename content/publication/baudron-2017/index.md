abstract: We assess whether forests contribute indirectly to the dietary diversity
  of rural households by supporting diverse agricultural production systems. We applied
  our study in a landscape mosaic in Southern Ethiopia that was divided into three
  zones of increasing distance to Munesa Forest 'near', 'intermediate', and 'distant'.
  A variety of research tools and methods, including remote sensing, participatory
  methods, farm survey, and yield assessment, were employed. Diets of households were
  more diverse in the near zone than in the other two zones (6.58 +/- 1.21, 5.38 +/- 1.02,
  and 4.41 +/- 0.77 food groups consumed daily in the near, intermediate, and distant
  zones, respectively). This difference was not explained by food items collected
  from Munesa Forest but by biomass flows from the forest to farmlands. Munesa Forest
  contributed an average of 6.13 ± 2.90 tons of biomass per farm and per year to the
  farms in the near zone, in the form of feed and fuelwood. Feed from the forest allowed
  for larger livestock herds in the near zone compared with the other two zones, and
  fuelwood from the forest reduced the need to use cattle dung as fuel in the near
  zone compared with the two other zones. These two biomass flows contributed to the
  availability of more manure to farmers closer to the forest (908 +/- 853 kg farm-1,
  771 +/- 717 kg farm-1, and 261 +/- 487 kg farm-1 in the near, intermediate, and distant
  zones, respectively). In turn, increased manure enabled a larger percentage of farms
  to cultivate a diversified homegarden (87, 64, and 39% of farms in the near, intermediate,
  and distant zones, respectively). Homegardens and livestock products provided the
  greater contribution to household dietary diversity closer to the forest.
