 abstract = {This chapter describes the history and current status of conservation agriculture (CA) in East and South Africa. It examines research results from East and South Africa in an effort to develop a clearer picture of the future of CA systems in the region. The yield and economic benefits, as well as the importance of mulch and crop rotation are described. The effect of CA on (i) soil quality (physical, chemical and biological), (ii) soil water balance, and (iii) weeds, pests and diseases is presented. Several challenges that hinder the spread of CA in East and South Africa are elaborated. Prospects for the widespread adoption of CA in these regions are given.},
