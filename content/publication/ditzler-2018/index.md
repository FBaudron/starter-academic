abstract: The increasingly complex challenges facing agricultural systems require
  problem-solving processes and systems analysis (SA) tools that engage multiple actors
  across disciplines. In this article, we employ the theory of affordances to unravel
  what tools may furnish users, and how those affordances contribute to a tool's usefulness
  in co-design and co-innovation processes. Affordance is defined as a function provided
  by an object through an interaction with a user. We first present a conceptual framework
  to assess the affordances of SA tools. This framework is then applied in a literature
  review of three SA tools used in agricultural systems research (fuzzy cognitive
  mapping, bio-economic whole-farm models, and role play and serious games). Through
  this exercise, we extend the SA tool design and implementation dialogue by illuminating
  (i) links between lower-level affordances, tool design, and heuristic functioning,
  and (ii) the central role of use setting and facilitation in mobilizing higher-level,
  productive affordances. Based on our findings, we make five propositions for how
  SA tool design and implementation in participatory problem-solving settings can
  be improved.
