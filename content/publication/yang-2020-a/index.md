abstract: Staple crops are grown by millions of smallholder farmers yet estimating
  field-level yields over broad regions can be challenging. Furthermore, agricultural
  productivity can be impacted by nearby forests and trees. In an agricultural-forest
  mosaic in Southern Ethiopia, we used remote sensing imagery to identify and differentiate
  among dominant crops and assess the impact of nearby forest patches on wheat productivity.
  Using a suite of vegetation indices (VIs) derived from high spatial resolution (5-10
  m) satellite imagery as a proxy for wheat productivity, we determined whether VIs
  were enhanced or suppressed with increasing distance to forest. We found that 5-10
  m resolution satellite imagery was sufficient for identifying and differentiating
  among field boundaries and dominant crops, however, imagery from higher spatial
  resolution satellites would see increased benefits in accuracy. VIs increased by
  as much as 5% in areas of the fields within 30 m of forest edges compared to fields
  further from forests. Our results highlight potential benefits of a landscape approach
  for enhancing smallholder agricultural productivity in Southern Ethiopia. High spatial
  resolution imagery is a cost-effective method to map and identify promising landscape
  approaches in agricultural-forest mosaics dominated by smallholder farms. Thus,
  a landscape perspective aided by remote-sensing can provide a straightforward and
  cost-effective way to monitor crop productivity and track changes in agricultural
  productivity due to forest fragmentation and/or restoration. A landscape approach
  to achieving food security goals, particularly within the context of climate considerations, and should play a more prominent role in planning forest conservation and restoration.
