abstract: Malnutrition linked to poor quality diets affects at least 2 billion people.
  Forests, as well as agricultural systems linked to trees, are key sources of dietary
  diversity in rural settings. In the present article, we develop conceptual links
  between diet diversity and forested landscape mosaics within the rural tropics.
  First, we summarize the state of knowledge regarding diets obtained from forests,
  trees, and agroforests. We then hypothesize how disturbed secondary forests, edge
  habitats, forest access, and landscape diversity can function in bolstering dietary
  diversity. Taken together, these ideas help us build a framework illuminating four
  pathways (direct, agroecological, energy, and market pathways) connecting forested
  landscapes to diet diversity. Finally, we offer recommendations to fill remaining
  knowledge gaps related to diet and forest cover monitoring. We argue that better
  evaluation of the role of land cover complexity will help avoid overly simplistic
  views of food security and, instead, uncover nutritional synergies with forest conservation
  and restoration.
