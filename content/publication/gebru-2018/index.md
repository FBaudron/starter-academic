abstract: A major problem faced by small-scale farmers in northern Ethiopia is reduced
  crop yield due to increasing soil degradation resulting from repeated tillage and
  inadequate agronomic management practices. These practices have left soils and rainfed
  crops susceptible to hazardous climatic events such as droughts. Sustainable farm
  practices such as minimum tillage and surface residue retention have been shown
  to improve soil health and crop productivity. The objectives of this field study
  were thus to evaluate the impacts of conservation agriculture (CA) practices on
  crop yield and economic productivity over 6 years in the eastern Tigray region of
  northern Ethiopia. Using a barley-wheat rotation from 2010 to 2016, the applied
  treatments were (i) permanent raised beds (PRB); (2) semi-permanent raised beds
  (SPB) and (3) conventional tillage (CT). Average barley and wheat biomass and grain
  yields in PRB and SPB treatments were consistently greater than yields under CT
  each year. In addition, the highest marginal rate of return was obtained in PRB
  and SPB compared to CT in all years (2010–2016). These results suggest that the
  CA practices of PRB and SPB can improve crop yield and profit compared to CT practices
  in the Tigray region.
