abstract: While the world's attention is focused on controlling COVID-19, evidence
  points at the biodiversity crisis as a leading factor in its emergence, and the
  outbreak of many past emerging infectious diseases. Agriculture is a major driver
  of biodiversity loss globally. Feeding a growing human population in ways that minimize
  harm to biodiversity is thus imperative to prevent the next COVID-19. Solutions
  exist, but the burden of implementing them should not be left to farmers alone,
  who are mainly small-scale family farmers. Supportive policies and markets are needed,
  but unlikely to bring about the required changes alone. A global concerted effort
  similar to the Paris Agreement for climate is probably required.
