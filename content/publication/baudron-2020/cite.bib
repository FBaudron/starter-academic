 abstract = {While the world's attention is focused on controlling COVID-19, evidence points at the biodiversity crisis as a leading factor in its emergence, and the outbreak of many past emerging infectious diseases. Agriculture is a major driver of biodiversity loss globally. Feeding a growing human population in ways that minimize harm to biodiversity is thus imperative to prevent the next COVID-19. Solutions exist, but the burden of implementing them should not be left to farmers alone, who are mainly small-scale family farmers. Supportive policies and markets are needed, but unlikely to bring about the required changes alone. A global concerted effort similar to the Paris Agreement for climate is probably required.},
