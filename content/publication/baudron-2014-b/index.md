abstract: Cereal residues represent a major resource for livestock feeding during
  the dry season in southern Africa. When kept on the soil surface instead of feeding
  them to livestock, crop residues can contribute to increasing soil fertility and
  maintaining crop productivity in the short- and the long-term. We explored these
  trade-offs for smallholder cotton-sorghum farming systems in the semi-arid Zambezi
  Valley, northern Zimbabwe. The analysis was done using simulation models at three
  scales, the plot, the farm and the territory, to simulate the effects of different
  sorghum residue allocations to livestock feeding vs. soil mulching, in combination
  with different application rates of mineral nitrogen fertilizer on crop productivity.
  The plot-scale simulations suggest that without N fertilization soil mulching has
  a positive effect on cotton yields only if small quantities of sorghum residues
  are used as mulch (average cotton yields of 2.24 +/- 0.41 kg ha-1 with a mulch of
  100 kg ha-1 vs. 1.91 +/- 0.29 kg ha-1 without mulch). Greater quantities of mulch
  have a negative effect on cotton yield without N fertilization due to N immobilization
  in the soil microbial biomass. With applications of 100 kg N ha-1, quantities of
  mulch up to 3 t ha-1 have no negative effect on cotton yield. Results at farm-scale
  highlight the fundamental role of livestock as a source of traction, and the need
  to feed a greater proportion of sorghum residues to livestock as herd and farm sizes
  increase. Farmers with no livestock attained maximum crop production when 100% of
  their sorghum residue remained in the field, as they do not have access to cattle
  manure. The optimum fraction of crop residue to be retained in the fields for maximum
  farm crop production varied for farmers with 2 or less heads of cattle (80% retention),
  with 2-3 heads (60-80%), with 4 or more heads (40-60%). At the scale of the entire
  territory, total cotton and sorghum production increased with the density of cattle,
  at the expense of soil mulching with crop residues. The results of our simulations
  suggest that (i) the optimum level of residue retention depends on the scale at
  which trade-offs are analyzed; (ii) the retention of all of the crop residue as
  mulch appears unrealistic and undesirable in farming systems that rely on livestock
  for traction; and (iii) crop residue mulching could be made more attractive to farmers
  by paying due attention to balancing C to N ratios in the soil and by promoting
  small-scale mechanization to replace animal traction. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
