abstract: 'Conservation agriculture (CA) systems represent a set of three soil management
  principles: minimarbance, permanent soil cover and crop rotations - whereas the
  CA-based systems in this study add the bed and furrow tillage techniques as integral
  elements of CA. Studies on the effects of long-term CA-based systems on soil health
  and crop productivity are rare globally, particularly in Ethiopia. This study aimed
  at investigating the long-term (2005-2013) influence of CA-based systems on soil
  health and crop productivity in northern Ethiopia. The treatments we used include
  two types of CA-based systems (permanent raised bed PRB and contour furrowing CF)
  and conventional tillage (CT) arranged in a randomized complete block design. Soil
  samples were collected at 0-10 cm soil depth to assess soil health. Piecewise structural
  equation modeling (PSEM) was used to analyze linkages between management practices,
  soil health and crop productivity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi spore abundance
  and root colonization was higher in PRB followed by CF compared to CT (p textless
  0.05). Significantly different soil N of 1.4 and 0.9 g kg-1 and available P of 6.7
  and 4.1 ppm were recorded for PRB and CT, respectively. Higher straw and grain yield
  of 12 and 4.3, 10 and 3.5, 8 and 2.8 t ha-1 were recorded for PRB, CF and CT, respectively.
  Outputs of the PSEM highlighted two pathways in which CA-based systems contributed
  to improved productivity: (a) via higher density of bacteria and improved hydraulic
  conductivity, and (b) via higher density of fungi and increase soil organic carbon
  content in the topsoil. The study concludes that CA-based systems have the potential
  to improve crop productivity through improved soil health.'
