abstract: Despite global commitments to forest restoration, evidence of the pathways
  through which restoration creates social and ecological benefits remains limited.
  The objective of this paper is to provide empirical evidence to generate insights
  on the relationship between forest cover change and key provisioning ecosystem services
  and reforestation pathways. In Southern Ethiopia, three zones along a gradient of
  decreasing land cover complexity and tree cover were examined. The land cover change
  was assessed using satellite remote sensing and complemented ground-based tree inventory.
  Perceptions of land cover and ecosystem services change and farmer responses were
  evaluated through three Participatory Rural Appraisals and eight Focus Group Discussions.
  Since the 1970s, a landscape shift from a forest-grassland to a cropland mosaic
  was associated with increased food production, improved food security, and higher
  incomes. However, this shift also coincided with reductions in livestock, construction
  materials, fuelwood and water availability, prompting reforestation efforts designed
  to recover some of these lost ecosystem services. In particular, some households
  established Eucalyptus woodlots and encouraged natural regeneration. Natural trees,
  Eucalyptus woodlots, Ensete plantations (a type of plantain), and grasslands were
  positively associated with homestead proximity; thus, homestead establishment resulting
  from population increase in this predominately agricultural landscape appeared to
  foster a viable forest restoration pathway—that is, 'more people, more trees'. This
  is a reforestation pathway not previously described in the literature. A return
  to a more diverse agricultural landscape mosaic provided more secure and diversified
  income sources along with better provisioning of construction materials, fuelwood,
  and higher livestock numbers.
