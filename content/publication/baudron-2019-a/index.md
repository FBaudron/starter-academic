abstract: Fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda J.E. Smith) is an invasive lepidopteran
  pest established in most of sub-Saharan Africa since 2016. Although the immediate
  reaction of governments has been to invest in chemical pesticides, control methods
  based on agronomic management would be more affordable to resource-constrained smallholders and minimize risks for health and the environment. However, little is known about the most effective agronomic practices that could control FAW under typical African
  smallholder conditions. In addition, the impact of FAW damage on yield in Africa
  has been reported as very large, but these estimates are mainly based on farmers'
  perceptions, and not on rigorous field scouting methods. Thus, the objectives of
  this study were to understand the factors influencing FAW damage in African smallholder
  maize fields and quantify its impact on yield, using two districts of Eastern Zimbabwe
  as cases. A total of 791 smallholder maize plots were scouted for FAW damage and
  the head of the corresponding farming household interviewed. Grain yield was later
  determined in about 20% of these fields. FAW damage was found to be significantly
  reduced by frequent weeding operations and by minimum- and zero-tillage. Conversely,
  pumpkin intercropping was found to significantly increase FAW damage. FAW damage
  was also found to be higher for some maize varieties, although these varieties may
  not be the lowest yielding. If the incidence of plants with FAW damage symptoms
  recorded in this research (32-48%, depending on the estimate used) is commensurate
  with what other studies conducted on the continent found, our best estimate of the
  impact of FAW damage on yield (11.57%) is much lower than what these studies reported.
  Although our study presents limitations, losses due to FAW damage in Africa could
  have been over-estimated. The threat that FAW represents for African smallholders,
  although very real, should not divert attention away from other pressing challenges
  they face.
