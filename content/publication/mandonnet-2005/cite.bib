 abstract = {The control of gastrointestinal nematodes requires an understanding of their epidemiology so that particular parasite stages can be targeted. Dam infection during early lactation is one example of this in ruminant nematode infections. The existence of the peri-parturient relaxation in immunity and its impact on productivity were examined in a Creole goat flock from Guadeloupe, exposed to mixed natural infection (predominantly Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis). A total of 1511 l were obtained from 909 does resulting from 463 dams and 150 sires. Fecal and blood samples were collected at kidding before anthelmintic drenching, 4 and 6 weeks after kidding. The traits analyzed were logarithm transformed fecal egg counts (FEC), packed cell volume (PCV), and logarithm transformed blood eosinophilia counts (EOS) for does at each sampling point and changes in these during the postpartum period. With the exception of the PCV values measured at kidding, lactating does had significantly higher FEC and lower PCV than control dry does at every sampling point. Geometric means of FEC in lactating does were 819 ?? 174, 677 ?? 146 and, 699 ?? 160 eggs per gram (EPG) at kidding, 4 and 6 weeks after kidding respectively. Geometric means of FEC in dry does were 187 ?? 57, 89 ?? 28, 133 ?? 43 at these time points, respectively. EOS differences were not consistent between groups and probably not specific enough for variations in Creole goats' peri-parturient rise to be discussed. As does aged, their egg output decreased and primiparous does always had greater egg output than multiparous ones. Overall, does' FEC at 4 weeks after kidding decreased by 1.3% each year. The higher the litter size, the higher the FEC at kidding and inverse applied for PCV measurements. Does that stopped lactating had significantly lower FEC and higher PCV values than lactating does with low milk yields. Higher infection rates during early lactation in Creole goats were recorded in does with lower maternal ability assessed by the average daily weight gain of kids between 10 and 30 days of age. Kids from dams with higher FEC (i.e. \textgreater600 EPG higher than corresponding does) had 17% lower average daily weight gain between 30 and 70 days postpartum and were approximately 1 kg lighter at weaning than kids from dams with lower FEC. Thus, it is clear that a peri-parturient rise in FEC exists in Creole goats. By controlling the intensity of this peri-parturient rise in FEC, herd health and productivity could be substantially improved. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
